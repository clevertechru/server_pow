# TCP server protected from DDOS attacks with the Proof of Work
## General
* Proper connection handling
* Timeouts to prevent hanging connections
* Worker pool for controlled concurrency
* Rate limiting
* Connection limiting
* Nonce tracking with window expiration
* Graceful shutdown
## PoW Algorithm Choice:
* Using SHA256 with a nonce-based challenge
* The server generates a random 32-byte challenge and a target (currently set to "0000")
* The client must find a nonce that, when combined with the challenge and timestamp, produces a hash starting with the target
* This is computationally intensive butÂ verifiable quickly
* The difficulty can be adjusted by changing the number of zeros in the target
